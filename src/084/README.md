# 084

Time taken: ~30mins

Things I learnt:

* I've known (theoretically) that you could do a lot of cool stuff with linear-gradient... it's the first time I've
attempted it. <http://asinglediv.com/> have some great examples - I have no idea how they manage this. Drawing with divs is kind of incredible. And thank god this one's easy.

I have no idea how people can draw with SVG either. All the paths...
