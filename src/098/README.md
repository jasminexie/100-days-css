# 098

Time taken: ~1.5hr

Things I learnt:

* Nothing much, but I do miss Javascript. `postcss-random` doesn't work as well as I hoped, but it's infinitely better
than hard-coding 16 animations.

* Good-looking animations take time and patience. If you're lazy like me... well, you'll get a sloppy box.
