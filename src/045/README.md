# 045

Time taken: ~20mins

I can't believe it - I've come full circle. A few months ago when I first
heard of these challenges I was bored and wanted to give it a try - and 045
was the first one I saw on that day. I looked, pokend around, looked at
other people's source code and thought "goddamn it I can't write this", not
with any animations that didn't involve SVG.

And after 40 days of CSS (because I've been busy and lazy and have skipped
quite a lot) I can actually do this. I know where to start with this. And
it's actually really, really easy for me right now, one of the easier
challenges in fact.

I haven't struggled with these challenges in at least a week. There are
things about CSS that still surprise me out of the blue and don't work the
way I'd expect, but I'm not a total idiot any more.

Damn.

I'm really proud of myself.
