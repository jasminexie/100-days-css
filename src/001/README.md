Time taken: ~30mins

Things I learnt:

This is an easy one.

* Pseudo elements are children. Their z-index stacks on top of tha parent.

* BUT no selector selects it other than the one you used to create it. Child
selectors and nth-child selectors don't work.

* And you can't select a sequdo-element in Javascript. You can see its styles
using CSSOM, though:
