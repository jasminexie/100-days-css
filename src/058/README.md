# 058

Time taken: ~45mins

Things I learnt:

* Area is proportional to the square of the radius. Height of each slice is
proportional to the radius. It's elementary school stuff and I almost forgot
about that.

* The order matters: use `postcss-calc` after `postcss-simple-vars` or else
you wouldn't be able to `calc()` anything with SCSS-style variables.

* 057 is a pain in the ass - make a regular icosahedron with HTML and CSS.
I can't for the life of me figure out the rotation angles of each side.
