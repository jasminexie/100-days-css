# 053

Time taken: ~0.5hr + 0.5hr

Okay, I'm cheating, (1) because I completed this on Day 052, and (2) because I spent a half an hour prior to coding to 
look into styling range inputs. And it's a nightmare.

Things I learnt:

1. User agent elements have pseudo-elements. I didn't actually know that. And each implementation differs in lots and
lots of ways... Here's a really good article: <https://css-tricks.com/sliding-nightmare-understanding-range-input/>

2. You can inspect pseudo-elements. 

3. First time using mixins here - I'm shamefully using them as a big style variable. Not very nice. But looking at the
docs and seeing how mixins *can* be used - wow.

Tired and seriously overworked. It's probably the first time since university that I've coded for a whole day (stopping
only to eat).
