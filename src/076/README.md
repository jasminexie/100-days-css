Time taken: ~30mins

Things I learnt:

* This is a combination of a lot of other things I learnt. For one -
`transform-style: preserve-3d` preserves z-index stack.

* The `backface-visibility` property. It isn't necessary for this challenge,
but the option is there.

* `filter: drop-shadow` - in this case, an infinitely better option than
transitioning and using multiple box-shadows.

* And z-index does not work on statically positioned elements.
